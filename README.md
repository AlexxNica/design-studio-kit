## Insight: "Just Enough Research"

#### Goal 
- Understand the people you're designing for.
- understand their needs, problems, behavior
- feel their delight, feel their pain (empathy)
- observe HOW they behave and understand WHY they do things
- "research is formalized curiosity" (Sarah Parmenter, @sazzy)

### "Guerilla User Research" 
> … because some research is better than no research.

**Techniques** 
- Observation (document on photo/video, stay in the background, ...)
- Interviews (how to pick the right people, eg. "extreme users", rules, tricks …)
- Another interactive technique where you let interviewees sketch something?

**Artifacts** 
- Personas (we show an example persona)
- Scenarios (we show an example scenario, where a certain need or problem is embedded in a story)
- Empathy Map (we can show the refined hagebau poster, it shows the time/journey aspect very well)
- TBD: short introduction of "jobs to be done" (for advanced usage?)
