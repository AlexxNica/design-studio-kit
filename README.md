# Design Studio Kit

**Why we do design studio, how we do it, what we learned and the material we use.**

(will be public with a page -> for workshop participants)

---

## General Intro

### Hello, my name is …
- Start the day with people introduction
- Give a simple introduction task to participants: let them sketch something in 5 minutes, put their name on the sheet and then shortly introduce themselves (name, function) and their sketch. This usually prevents too long anecdotes and job title bragging and also sets the mode for the day, where everybody will use a pen and paper and limited time.

[Example Introduction Task](introduction-task-example.pdf)

### Housekeeping
- Introduce yourself again as the instructor/facilitator of the day
- Present a well structured agenda of the day
- Talk about breaks – they are the only slots for coffee and checking mails (otherwise the energy breaks)
- Only use as many slides as necessary. It's about making things and collaborating, not listening to a single person.

### Goals
- Making → not talking
- Sketch UI → User Perspective
- Insight → Empathy

- Level playing field.
- Idea exploration.
- Team buy-in.
- Ownership/Investment.

## Designing the teams
> (WIP - emphasize importance, show envelopes as principle but also material, provide template, "concept of adding "trouble makers" to teams)

---

## Introducing the Design Studio Method
> (WIP - slide free, show examples of visualization, list tips, show wall layout, show labeled kapa boards etc)

## Insight: "Just Enough Research"

### Goal 
- Understand the people you're designing for.
- understand their needs, problems, behavior
- feel their delight, feel their pain (empathy)
- observe HOW they behave and understand WHY they do things

> "research is formalized curiosity" (Sarah Parmenter, @sazzy)

### "Guerilla User Research" 
… because some research is better than no research.

#### Why do we carry out research?
- To frame the problem right?“Framing the problem right is 90% of the work” (Einstein)
- To achieve good, relevant and sustainable solutions

#### How to carry out design research? 

**1. Define the problem and what you want to find out**

2. How: Plan and prepare for the Research (research techniques)

*Research techniques*
- Say: Interviews
- Do: Observation, diaries, etc
- Make: Sketching, collages, etc

**3. Who: Find the right people to interview**
- Experienced something specific recently
- Extreme users

**4. Collect the data: Carrying out interviews**
- Tips to carry out interviews
- Tips on recording interviews

**5. Analyze the data**

**6. Report the results**
- Personas  (developed according to specific jobs to be done and or to specific contexts of use)
- Scenarios
- Empathy Map 
- Jobs to be done
