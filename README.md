# Design Studio Kit

**Why we do design studio, how we do it, what we learned and the material we use.**

(will be public with a page -> for workshop participants)

---

## General Intro

### Hello, my name is …
- Start the day with people introduction
- Give a simple introduction task to participants: let them sketch something in 5 minutes, put their name on the sheet and then shortly introduce themselves (name, function) and their sketch. This usually prevents too long anecdotes and job title bragging and also sets the mode for the day, where everybody will use a pen and paper and limited time.

[Example Introduction Task](introduction-task-example.pdf)

### Housekeeping
- Introduce yourself again as the instructor/facilitator of the day
- Present a well structured agenda of the day
- Talk about breaks – they are the only slots for coffee and checking mails (otherwise the energy breaks)
- Only use as many slides as necessary. It's about making things and collaborating, not listening to a single person.

### Goals
- Making → not talking
- Sketch UI → User Perspective
- Insight → Empathy

## Why Design Studio
- Interdisciplinary.
- Level playing field.
- Idea exploration.
- Team buy-in.
- Ownership/Investment.

---

## Designing the teams
> (WIP - emphasize importance, show envelopes as principle but also material, provide template, "concept of adding "trouble makers" to teams)

---

## Introducing the Design Studio Method
> (WIP - slide free, show examples of visualization, list tips, show wall layout, show labeled kapa boards etc)

## Insight: "Just Enough Research"

#### Goal 
- Understand the people you're designing for.
- understand their needs, problems, behavior
- feel their delight, feel their pain (empathy)
- observe HOW they behave and understand WHY they do things
- "research is formalized curiosity" (Sarah Parmenter, @sazzy)

### "Guerilla User Research" 
> … because some research is better than no research.

**Techniques** 
- Observation (document on photo/video, stay in the background, ...)
- Interviews (how to pick the right people, eg. "extreme users", rules, tricks …)
- Another interactive technique where you let interviewees sketch something?

**Artifacts** 
- Personas (we show an example persona)
- Scenarios (we show an example scenario, where a certain need or problem is embedded in a story)
- Empathy Map (we can show the refined hagebau poster, it shows the time/journey aspect very well)
- TBD: short introduction of "jobs to be done" (for advanced usage?)
